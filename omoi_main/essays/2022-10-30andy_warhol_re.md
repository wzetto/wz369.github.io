两周前去京瓷看了人生第一场AW特展，买入TATE的小册子（？，语句精辟。正巧计划今年剩下的食堂阅读时间看看现代社会相关，故以此作序吧。

> "For Warhol, the kind of love that counted was that of the fan for the star - love that linked private fantasy with public image, a love at a distance."

贯穿50-70s作品始终的是infinitely generative process, 

> "...that I would just stop comics altogether and go in other directions where I could come out first - like quantity and repetition."

- 以及，对于经典作品本身，最常见的切入点是：

1.对于单个对象：
> "...'it's society, it's who we are, it's absolutely beautiful and naked,'..."

2.对于***重复***：
> These works dissolve their everyday subject matter by <u>extreme repetition into vast, near-abstract fields</u>.

> ...for Warhol's **degradation** of the photographic image...

> ...where the silkscreen printing's progressive blurring and darkening brings her image to the point of **disintegration**.

以及，蒙娜丽莎系列将单一作品x30，成为recycled, repeated, destabilised的现代消耗品，相当于将复制作品的**独特性**解释为recycled, repeated, destabilised本身。如《消费社会》中言，现代商品的价值藏在了其消耗性本身。

还有可能的核心内容:

> ...the commodification and emptiness at the core of America's postwar consumer culture; whether this is accurate is uncertain.

- 对于实验电影：

> "What bothered me was the way the television and radio were **programming everybody to feel so sad**."

> "We were **shooting so many**, we never even bothered to give titles to a lot of them. Friends would stop by and they'd wind up in front of the camera, the star of that afternoon's reel."

对于帝国大厦（在京瓷花了30秒观看（，睡眠作品，个人理解是：'shooting so many'可想象成一个时间容器内的极多的离散状态。而固定镜头无叙事和移动的超长电影则是去掉了所有离散状态，将整个作品**降解**成了，观者最后仅仅会关注的，时间容器本身。

- 对于晚期的光影系列：

> They occupy a space between representation and abstraction,..., which similarly point to a **threshold**.
